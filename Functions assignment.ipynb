    "# 1. Definition and Scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function: A function is a standalone block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from anywhere in the code.\n",
    "  Functions are defined using the def keyword outside of any class.\n",

    "  Methods are defined inside classes and are called on instances (objects) of those classes.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# 2. Binding:\n",
    "- Function: Functions are not tied to any particular object; they can operate on data passed to them as arguments.\n",
    "- Method: Methods are bound to objects. They automatically receive the instance (self) as the first argument,\n",
    "  allowing them to access and modify the object’s state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3. Calling:\n",
    "- Function: A function is called by its name, followed by parentheses, e.g., function_name().\n",
    "- Method: A method is called on an object using the dot notation, e.g., object_name.method_name().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "** Function Example: **\n",
    "# Function definition\n",

    "- Transformation: map() is primarily used for applying a transformation function to every item in a sequence.\n",
